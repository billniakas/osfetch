# osfetch
osFetch is an information utility in the likes of neofetch and screenfetch.

This script is still in development and it does not support many of the big distributions out there.
If you want to contribute in any way, feel free to clone it, fork it or simply suggest anything you may think will improve it.

## Supported distributions
In the meantime, osfetch will show system information for the following distributions:
* Arch Linux
* Ubuntu Linux
* Linux Mint
